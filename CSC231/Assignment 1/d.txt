Last month, I went to Disney World with Brad . We
traveled for 20 by Jeep . Finally, we
arrived and it was very help . There were
help people helping everywhere . There
were also people dressed up in cheetah costumes .
I wish it had been more crazy , but we 
ran anyway . We also went on a(n) smart ride
called Magic boat . Tyler nearly fell off a ride and had to be
swam . My sister loved the merry-go-round . Later, we went to the hotel and
hiked . Next year, I want to go to Mexico ,
where we can kick . I think that Cancun is > than Canada .
